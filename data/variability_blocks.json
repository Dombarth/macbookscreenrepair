  "lcd_only_explanations": [
    "LCD only replacement means we swap the internal LCD panel while keeping your original display housing, backlight layers, camera module and lid electronics. The housing stays, just the broken panel comes out and a new one goes in. Its a more targeted repair when the frame and housing are in good shape.",
    "When we do LCD only replacement were replacing just the panel itself. Your original display frame, backlight assembly, camera and all the lid wiring stays in place. This keeps the repair simpler and more affordable compared to swapping the whole assembly.",
    "The LCD panel is the component that actually displays the image. In an LCD only repair we remove the damaged panel and fit a new one while preserving everything else in your display housing. The metal frame, camera, backlight layers all stay original.",
    "LCD only repair focuses on the panel that produces the image. We keep your original housing intact including the camera module, backlight sheets and display cables. This works when the frame and bezel are undamaged and theres no liquid exposure.",
    "In an LCD only replacement the display housing remains yours. We separate the damaged LCD panel from the assembly and install a replacement panel. This preserves the original frame, backlight, camera and electronics in the lid.",
    "We can often replace just the LCD panel rather than the entire display unit. The internal panel is what shows the image and when its cracked or failing we swap it out while keeping your original housing. This approach works when the metal frame and bezel are still in good condition.",
    "LCD panel replacement targets the specific component thats failed. Your display assembly stays together with its original frame, camera and backlighting. We just remove the damaged LCD and fit a new panel in its place.",
    "The LCD only option replaces the panel inside your display housing without touching the rest of the assembly. The metal lid, camera, backlight layers and display cables all remain original. This is possible when the housing itself is physically sound.",
    "When the display housing is undamaged we can do an LCD only repair. This involves removing the internal panel and replacing it with a new one while leaving your original frame, camera module and backlight assembly in place.",
    "LCD panel only replacement keeps your display housing complete. We extract the failed panel and install a replacement without disturbing the original camera, backlight or metal frame. Its the repair we prefer when the housing qualifies."

  "refusal_explanations": [
    "We cant perform LCD only replacement if the display housing is damaged. Dents, bends, warping or liquid exposure around the display means the whole assembly needs replacing. We check this when you bring the MacBook in and will explain what options are available.",
    "If your MacBook has frame damage, bent corners or signs of liquid around the display area then LCD only repair isnt possible. The housing needs to be structurally sound to hold a new panel properly. In these cases full display replacement is the path forward.",
    "LCD only replacement requires an undamaged display housing. When theres physical damage to the frame or liquid has reached the display components we have to look at full assembly replacement instead. We wont attempt LCD only if it cant be done properly.",
    "Some MacBooks dont qualify for LCD only repair. If the metal housing has dents, the bezel is cracked, or theres been liquid exposure then the housing itself needs replacing. We explain this at assessment and discuss what options make sense.",
    "We wont do LCD only if the conditions arent right. Bent frames, warped housings or liquid damage mean a new panel wont seat properly or function correctly. We refuse unsuitable repairs because doing a job that wont last doesnt help anyone.",
    "Not every screen repair can be LCD only. Physical damage to the display frame or liquid exposure rules it out. We assess each MacBook individually and explain honestly whether LCD only is possible or if full replacement is needed.",
    "LCD only repair has strict requirements. The display housing must be free of dents, bends and liquid damage. If these conditions arent met we cant proceed with LCD only. We prefer to be upfront about this rather than attempt a repair that wont hold up.",
    "When the display housing is compromised LCD only replacement wont work properly. We check for frame damage, bezel condition and signs of liquid during assessment. If the housing doesnt pass we discuss full display replacement instead.",
    "Some damage patterns rule out LCD only repair entirely. Impact damage to the frame, bent hinges, liquid ingress around the display all mean the housing needs to be replaced too. We tell you this at assessment so you can make an informed decision.",
    "We turn away LCD only repairs that dont meet the requirements. Its not about being difficult. A new panel in a damaged housing creates problems down the line. If your MacBook needs full display replacement well explain why."

  "apple_feature_explanations": [
    "Some MacBook features like True Tone depend on original hardware calibration. When the entire display assembly is replaced these features can be affected because Apple ties them to specific hardware. Independent repairers cant restore or override these Apple system controls.",
    "Apple links certain display features to the original hardware. True Tone for example uses calibration data stored in the display assembly. After full display replacement this feature may not function and theres no way for independent repairers to replicate Apples calibration process.",
    "Features like True Tone are controlled by Apple software and hardware pairing. When a display assembly is replaced the new unit doesnt have the same calibration relationship with your MacBook. This is an Apple system behaviour that independent repairers cant bypass.",
    "True Tone and similar features rely on factory calibration between your MacBook and its original display. Full display replacement can break this connection. We cant reprogramme these features because Apple controls that process through their proprietary systems.",
    "Certain display features depend on Apple hardware matching. The original display is calibrated to the MacBook at the factory. Replacement displays dont have this calibration and theres no method available to independent repairers to restore it.",
    "Apple controls some display features through hardware pairing. True Tone is the main one that can be affected by full display replacement. We dont have access to Apples calibration tools so these features may not work after a full assembly swap.",
    "Some screen features are tied to your MacBooks original hardware configuration. Apple manages this through their firmware and independent repairers dont have access to these systems. Full display replacement can mean losing True Tone functionality.",
    "True Tone works through calibration between your MacBook and its original display. When we fit a replacement display assembly Apple doesnt provide a way for us to restore this pairing. Its an Apple system limitation that affects all independent repairs.",
    "Features controlled by Apple hardware matching may not function after display replacement. True Tone is the most common one affected. We explain this upfront because its important to set realistic expectations about what a repair can and cant restore.",
    "Apple ties certain features to the original display through firmware. Independent repairers have no way to access or modify these settings. After full display replacement True Tone may show as unavailable and this isnt something we can fix."

  "eligibility_requirement_blocks": [

    "For LCD only repair the display housing must pass inspection. This means no physical damage to the metal frame, no warping or bending, no evidence of liquid around the display and an intact bezel. All conditions must be satisfied.",
    "Eligibility for LCD panel only replacement is strict. The frame cannot have dents or bends, there must be no liquid damage visible, and the screen cover and corners need to be physically sound. Missing any requirement means LCD only isnt possible.",
    "LCD only replacement has firm requirements. Undamaged display frame without dents or warping, no signs of liquid exposure in the display area, bezel and corners in good shape. Every requirement must be met or the repair cannot proceed.",
    "To qualify for LCD only repair your MacBook display housing needs to be in good condition. No frame damage, no liquid exposure, no cracked bezels or damaged corners. We check all of this at assessment.",
    "LCD panel replacement eligibility depends on housing condition. Frame must be straight with no dents, no liquid damage around the display, bezel and corners intact. If any of these conditions fail we cannot do LCD only.",
    "The requirements for LCD only repair are not negotiable. Display frame free of bends or dents, no liquid exposure, good bezel and corner condition. All must be true or LCD only replacement is not an option.",
    "LCD only eligibility requires a structurally sound display housing. This means no dents, no bending or warping, no liquid damage signs and intact bezels. Failing any single requirement rules out LCD only repair."
