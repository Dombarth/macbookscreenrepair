                    <h2>MacBook Air 13" M2 Screen Repair</h2>
                    <p>At MacBook Screen Repair we specialise in the aspects of screen replacement for the MacBook Air 13 inch M2 released in 2022. This is model identifier A2681. The team provide LCD only replacement and full display assembly replacement depending on what condition the housing is in when it comes through.</p>
                    
                    <p>The 2022 MacBook Air with M2 chip was a complete redesign from the M1 generation. New chassis, new display with the notch design, and a 13.6 inch Liquid Retina screen running at 2560 x 1664 resolution. When screens get damaged we can replace either just the LCD panel or the complete display assembly depending on what the damage looks like.</p>

                    <h2>The Redesigned Display</h2>
                    <p>The MacBook Air 13" M2 introduced the notch design to the Air lineup. Slim bezels around the display with the camera sitting in a notch at the top. This was a big change from the M1 Air which had the older style bezels. The display supports True Tone and P3 wide colour gamut with 500 nits brightness.</p>
                    
                    <p>Inside the display assembly theres the LCD panel, backlight layers, camera module and display cabling. When we do LCD only repairs we swap just the panel and keep everything else in place. When full display replacement is needed the whole assembly gets replaced.</p>

                    <div class="info-box">
                        <p><strong>Model Specifications:</strong><br>
                        Model: MacBook Air 13" M2 (2022)<br>
                        Model Identifier: A2681<br>
                        Display: 13.6" Liquid Retina, 2560 x 1664<br>
                        Chip: Apple M2</p>
                    </div>

                    <h2>LCD Only Replacement</h2>
                    <p>LCD only replacement for the MacBook Air M2 means swapping just the internal LCD panel while still keeping your original display housing intact. Metal frame stays in place, camera module stays, backlight assembly and all the cabling stays. We just remove the damaged panel and fit a new one.</p>
                    
                    <p>This repair type is available when the display housing meets the eligibility requirements. No dents or bends in the frame. No signs of liquid exposure around the display. Bezel and corners in good condition. The team at MacBook Screen Repair check all of this at assessment before quoting.</p>
                    
                    <p>LCD only is our preferred repair when conditions allow. Its more targeted than full display replacement. Keeps your original housing and camera. True Tone usually stays working because the original electronics remain in place.</p>

                    <h2>Full Display Replacement</h2>
                    <p>Full display replacement for the MacBook Air M2 is necessary when the housing itself has damage. Dented frame, bent corners, liquid exposure around the display area, cracked bezels. These situations mean LCD only wont work properly and full replacement is required.</p>
                    
                    <p>With full display replacement we swap the entire lid assembly. New housing, new LCD panel, new camera module, new backlight, new cables. As such its a bigger repair than LCD only but sometimes thats what the MacBook needs to get working properly again.</p>
                    
                    <p>Full display replacement can affect True Tone. Apple ties this feature to the original display through firmware pairing. The replacement assembly doesnt have this pairing and independent repairers cant restore it. Everything else works fine but True Tone may not be available.</p>

                    <h2>Common Screen Issues</h2>
                    <p>We see alot of the same screen problems on MacBook Air M2 models. Cracked screens from drops are the most common. The slim design means theres not alot of protection around the display if it takes an impact. Dead displays, flickering screens, lines running across the display, backlight issues where parts are brighter or dimmer than they should be.</p>
                    
                    <p>The M2 Air has been out for a few years now so weve seen our fair share of damaged ones come through. The repair type depends on the condition of the housing when we assess it.</p>

                    <h2>Identifying Your Model</h2>
                    <p>The MacBook Air 13" M2 is model A2681. Check your model by clicking the Apple menu and selecting About This Mac. It shows the model name and year. The model identifier is also on the bottom of the machine near the regulatory markings.</p>
                    
                    <p>If your not sure whether you have the M2 or M1 Air the easiest way to tell is the notch. The M2 has the notch at the top of the display, the M1 has the older style bezels. Bring it in and we can confirm which model you have.</p>

                    <h2>Drop Off Service</h2>
