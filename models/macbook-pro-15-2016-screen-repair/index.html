                    <h2>MacBook Pro 15" 2016 Display Overview</h2>
                    <p>The late 2016 MacBook Pro 15" introduced major design changes to Apple's professional notebook line. The A1707 model identifier covers this first generation Touch Bar 15" which brought a thinner profile, USB-C exclusively, and the controversial butterfly keyboard. This redesign represented a significant departure from the previous Retina MacBook Pro chassis that had been refined since 2012. Screen repairs on these units require understanding of the new display architecture.</p>
                    
                    <p>Mac Screen Repair Sydney specialise in the aspects of LCD panel replacement for 2016 15" MacBook Pro models. The thinner display assembly introduced with this model presents specific challenges during repair. We've worked on alot of these first gen Touch Bar units and understand how to handle them properly. Quality parts and careful technique deliver results matching original specifications.</p>

                    <h2>Available Repair Options</h2>
                    <p>Two repair methods address screen damage on the 15" 2016. LCD only replacement involves removing the damaged internal panel while keeping your original aluminium housing intact. This requires housing without dents, bends, or structural damage. Full display assembly replacement swaps the entire top section when housing damage prevents LCD only repair or when display cable issues necessitate complete replacement.</p>
                    
                    <p>The team at Mac Screen Repair Sydney assess every device before suggesting a repair path. We dont push full assemblies when LCD only achieves equivalent results. Your housing condition and the nature of your damage determine our recommendation. Honest evaluation means you get appropriate repair for your situation without overpaying.</p>

                    <h2>Display Technical Details</h2>
                    <p>The A1707 features a 15.4-inch LED-backlit IPS Retina display running at 2880 x 1800 native resolution. This delivers 220 pixels per inch for crisp text and detailed images. The panel covers the P3 wide colour gamut which matters for colour accurate work in photography and video. Maximum brightness reaches 500 nits which handles typical indoor lighting well.</p>
                    
                    <p>The 2016 model does not include True Tone technology which arrived with the 2018 refresh. There's no ambient white balance adjustment on this generation. For repair purposes, this simplifies things since theres no calibration data to consider preserving. Both repair methods deliver identical display functionality.</p>

                    <h2>Known Issues - Flexgate</h2>
                    <p>The 2016 15" MacBook Pro gained notoriety for display cable failures commonly called flexgate. Apple's design routed the display cable through the hinge area where repeated opening and closing creates wear over time. The cable eventually fails, causing a characteristic stage light effect where a bright band appears at the bottom of the screen. As damage progresses, the display may fail completely at certain angles.</p>
                    
                    <p>Apple acknowledged this issue and extended warranty coverage for affected units, though many machines now fall outside that program. The team have repaired numerous flexgate cases on A1707 models. Full display assembly replacement addresses cable issues definitively since it includes a new cable assembly. We diagnose whether your symptoms indicate cable wear versus panel damage.</p>

                    <h2>Common Display Damage</h2>
                    <p>Beyond flexgate, physical damage causes most screen repairs we see. Cracked glass from drops or impacts, LCD fractures from pressure, and backlight failures from internal component damage. The thin display assembly on the 2016 redesign provides less protection against pressure than earlier thicker designs. Objects pressing against closed MacBooks cause alot of the pressure damage we repair.</p>
                    
                    <p>Impact damage typically shows visible crack patterns or fracture points. Pressure damage may not show external cracks but creates visible LCD distortion, dead pixel clusters, or discolored patches. We accurately diagnose damage type since this affects repair approach and outcomes.</p>

                    <h2>Repair Outcomes</h2>
                    <p>Since the 2016 15" lacks True Tone, repair outcomes are straightforward. Both LCD only and full assembly replacement restore full display functionality without any features lost. Your repaired screen performs exactly like the original with P3 colour gamut, proper brightness levels, and correct resolution. We test every repair thoroughly before returning devices.</p>
                    
                    <p>For flexgate repairs specifically, full assembly replacement resolves the issue permanently since the failure point gets replaced entirely. LCD only repair can address panel damage but wont solve underlying cable wear if thats the root cause. Proper diagnosis ensures we apply the right solution.</p>

                    <h2>Pricing and Service Timeline</h2>
                    <p>MacBook Pro 15" 2016 screen repair cost varies with repair type required. LCD only replacement is more economical when housing condition permits. Full assembly handles both panel and housing or cable issues when necessary. We quote after inspecting your device since photos dont capture all relevant details. Assessment carries no obligation to proceed.</p>
                    
                    <p>Most 15" 2016 repairs complete within 24-48 hours depending on parts availability. Parts for this generation remain available though supply varies. Rush service may be possible for urgent situations. Contact us to discuss timeline requirements.</p>

                    <h2>Value of Repair</h2>
                    <p>The 2016 15" MacBook Pro remains functional hardware despite its age. Quad-core Intel processors and AMD graphics handle many professional tasks adequately. Screen repair extends usable life at reasonable cost compared to replacement. Rather than discarding functional hardware due to display damage, professional repair restores capability.</p>
                    
                    <p>Mac Screen Repair Sydney has serviced A1707 models since they launched. We understand this generation's specific challenges including flexgate considerations. Reach out to discuss your MacBook Pro 15" 2016 screen repair requirements.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What is flexgate exactly?</h3>
                    <p>Flexgate refers to display cable failures caused by wear at the hinge. The flexible cable routing in 2016-2017 Touch Bar models creates stress during normal opening and closing, eventually causing backlight failure or display issues.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Is the 2016 display same as 2017?</h3>
                    <p>Yes, both the 2016 and 2017 15" Touch Bar models use identical A1707 display assemblies. Parts are fully interchangeable between these model years.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Can LCD only repair fix flexgate?</h3>
                    <p>LCD only repair replaces the panel but keeps the original cables. If flexgate cable wear is the issue, full assembly replacement provides the permanent solution since it includes new cables.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Should I repair or replace this model?</h3>
                    <p>This depends on your usage needs and the repair cost versus replacement options. The 2016 15" remains capable for many tasks. Repair extends usable life economically if the rest of the machine works well.</p>
