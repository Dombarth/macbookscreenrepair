                    <h2>MacBook Air 13" M3 Screen Repair</h2>
                    <p>At MacBook Screen Repair we service the MacBook Air 13 inch M3 model released in 2024. This is model identifier A3113. The team provide LCD only replacement and full display assembly replacement depending on the condition of your MacBook Air.</p>
                    
                    <p>The 2024 MacBook Air with M3 chip has a 13.6 inch Liquid Retina display with 2560 x 1664 resolution. When the screen gets damaged whether from a drop, impact or other cause we can replace either just the LCD panel or the complete display assembly depending on what the damage requires.</p>

                    <h2>About the MacBook Air M3 Display</h2>
                    <p>The MacBook Air 13" M3 uses the same display design as the M2 generation Air. 13.6 inch Liquid Retina display with slim bezels and the notch housing the camera at the top. The display supports True Tone, P3 wide colour gamut and 500 nits brightness.</p>
                    
                    <p>Inside the display assembly there is the LCD panel, backlight layers, camera module and display cabling. When we do LCD only repair we replace just the panel and keep all the other components. When full display replacement is needed the entire assembly gets swapped out.</p>

                    <div class="info-box">
                        <p><strong>Model Specifications:</strong><br>
                        Model: MacBook Air 13" M3 (2024)<br>
                        Model Identifier: A3113<br>
                        Display: 13.6" Liquid Retina, 2560 x 1664<br>
                        Chip: Apple M3</p>
                    </div>

                    <h2>LCD Only Replacement</h2>
                    <p>LCD only replacement for the MacBook Air M3 means swapping just the internal LCD panel while keeping your original display housing intact. The metal frame, camera module, backlight assembly and all the cabling stays in place. We just remove the damaged panel and fit a new one.</p>
                    
                    <p>This repair type is available when the display housing meets the eligibility requirements. No dents, bends or warping in the frame. No signs of liquid exposure. Bezel and corners in good condition. We check all of this at assessment.</p>
                    
                    <p>LCD only is our preferred repair when the conditions allow. Its more targeted than full display replacement. Keeps your original housing and camera. Usually preserves True Tone functionality since the original electronics stay in place.</p>

                    <h2>Full Display Replacement</h2>
                    <p>Full display replacement for the MacBook Air M3 is necessary when the housing itself is damaged. Dented frame, bent corners, liquid exposure around the display, cracked bezels. These situations mean LCD only wont work properly.</p>
                    
                    <p>With full display replacement we swap the entire lid assembly. New housing, new LCD panel, new camera, new backlight, new cables. Everything. This is a bigger repair than LCD only but sometimes its what the MacBook needs.</p>
                    
                    <p>Full display replacement can affect True Tone. Apple ties this feature to the original display through firmware pairing. The replacement assembly doesnt have this pairing. Independent repairers cant restore it. The display works fine for everything else just True Tone may not be available.</p>

                    <h2>Common Screen Issues</h2>
                    <p>We see the usual range of screen issues on MacBook Air M3 models. Cracked screens from drops are common. The slim design means not alot of protection around the display if it takes an impact. Sometimes the MacBook gets knocked off a desk or something lands on it when closed.</p>
                    
                    <p>Dead displays where the screen wont show anything at all. Can happen after impact or sometimes randomly. Flickering screens, lines running across the display, backlight issues where parts are brighter or dimmer than others. These are all repairable with the right approach.</p>
                    
                    <p>The repair type depends on the condition of the housing. If the frame is undamaged LCD only usually sorts it. If theres frame damage then full display replacement is needed.</p>

                    <h2>Identifying Your Model</h2>
                    <p>The MacBook Air 13" M3 is model A3113. You can check your model by clicking the Apple menu and selecting About This Mac. It shows the model name and year. The model identifier (A3113) is also on the bottom of the machine near the regulatory markings.</p>
                    
                    <p>If youre not sure what model you have bring it in and we can check. The team are familiar with all the MacBook Air models and can identify which one you have at assessment.</p>

                    <h2>Pricing</h2>
                    <p>LCD only replacement for MacBook Air 13" M3 starts from around $420. Full display replacement costs more because youre getting the complete assembly. Exact pricing is confirmed at assessment once we see the MacBook and determine which repair type is needed.</p>
                    
                    <p>We dont quote over the phone or from photos. The housing condition determines which repair is possible and that needs to be assessed in person. Drop off takes a few minutes and you get accurate pricing.</p>

                    <h2>Drop Off Service</h2>
                    <p>All MacBook Air M3 screen repairs are drop off only. You bring the MacBook in, we assess the damage and housing condition, determine whether LCD only or full display replacement is needed and give you accurate pricing. No shipping, no mail in service.</p>
                    
                    <p>We service customers across Western Sydney, The Hills District and North West Sydney areas. Parramatta, Castle Hill, Blacktown, Penrith, Rouse Hill and all the surrounding suburbs.</p>
