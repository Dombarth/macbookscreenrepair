                    <h2>MacBook Air 15" M3 Screen Repair</h2>
                    <p>At MacBook Screen Repair we specialise in the aspects of screen replacement for the MacBook Air 15 inch M3 released in 2024. This is model identifier A3114. The team provide LCD only replacement and full display assembly replacement depending on what condition the housing is in.</p>
                    
                    <p>The 15 inch MacBook Air with M3 chip has a 15.3 inch Liquid Retina display running at 2880 x 1864 resolution. Its the same panel design as the M2 generation 15 inch with P3 wide colour and True Tone support. When screens get damaged we can replace either just the LCD panel or the complete display assembly depending on what the damage requires.</p>

                    <h2>About the Display</h2>
                    <p>The MacBook Air 15" M3 uses the larger display size that Apple introduced with the M2 generation Air. 15.3 inches with slim bezels and the notch housing the camera at the top. The extra screen real estate makes it popular with people who want more room to work but dont want the weight of a MacBook Pro.</p>
                    
                    <p>Inside the display assembly theres the LCD panel, backlight layers, camera module and all the cabling. When we do LCD only repairs we swap just the panel and leave everything else in place. When full display replacement is needed the whole assembly gets swapped out.</p>

                    <div class="info-box">
                        <p><strong>Model Specifications:</strong><br>
                        Model: MacBook Air 15" M3 (2024)<br>
                        Model Identifier: A3114<br>
                        Display: 15.3" Liquid Retina, 2880 x 1864<br>
                        Chip: Apple M3</p>
                    </div>

                    <h2>LCD Only Replacement</h2>
                    <p>LCD only replacement for the MacBook Air 15" M3 means swapping just the internal LCD panel while keeping your original display housing intact. The metal frame stays, camera module stays, backlight assembly and all the cabling stays in place. We remove the damaged panel and fit a new one.</p>
                    
                    <p>This repair type is available when the display housing meets eligibility requirements. No dents or bends in the frame. No signs of liquid exposure around the display area. Bezel and corners need to be in good condition. The team at MacBook Screen Repair check all of this at assessment before providing a quote.</p>
                    
                    <p>LCD only is our preferred repair when the housing condition allows for it. Its more targeted than full display replacement while still keeping your original housing and camera. True Tone usually stays working because the original electronics remain in place.</p>

                    <h2>Full Display Replacement</h2>
                    <p>Full display replacement for the MacBook Air 15" M3 is necessary when the housing itself has damage. Dented frame, bent corners, liquid exposure around the display, cracked bezels. These situations mean LCD only wont work properly.</p>
                    
                    <p>With full display replacement we swap the entire lid assembly. New housing, new LCD panel, new camera module, new backlight, new cables. As such its a bigger repair than LCD only but sometimes thats what the MacBook needs to get working properly again.</p>
                    
                    <p>Full display replacement can affect True Tone functionality. Apple ties this feature to the original display through firmware pairing. The replacement assembly doesnt have this pairing and independent repairers cant restore it. Everything else works fine but True Tone may not be available after full display replacement.</p>

                    <h2>Common Screen Issues</h2>
                    <p>We see the usual range of screen problems on MacBook Air 15" M3 models that come through. Cracked screens from drops are common. The larger display means theres alot more surface area that can crack if it takes an impact. Dead displays where the screen wont show anything, flickering, lines across the display, backlight issues.</p>
                    
                    <p>The larger size makes these MacBooks a bit more awkward to carry around which can lead to drops. Weve seen quite a few come in with cracked corners from being dropped while moving between rooms or knocked off tables.</p>

                    <h2>Model Identification</h2>
                    <p>The MacBook Air 15" M3 is model A3114. You can check your model by clicking the Apple menu and selecting About This Mac. It shows the model name and year. The model identifier is also printed on the bottom of the machine near the regulatory markings if you flip it over.</p>
                    
                    <p>If your not sure whether you have the M3 or M2 version of the 15 inch Air bring it in and we can check. The team are familiar with all MacBook Air models and can identify which one you have.</p>

                    <h2>Drop Off Service</h2>
