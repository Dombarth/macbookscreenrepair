                    <h2>MacBook Air 13" M1 Screen Repair</h2>
                    <p>At MacBook Screen Repair we specialise in the aspects of screen replacement for the MacBook Air 13 inch M1 released in late 2020. This is model identifier A2337. The team provide LCD only replacement and full display assembly replacement depending on what condition the housing is in when it comes in.</p>
                    
                    <p>The M1 MacBook Air was the first Apple Silicon Mac ever released. Same physical design as the Intel Air that came before it but with the new M1 chip inside. The display is a 13.3 inch Retina panel running at 2560 x 1600 resolution with True Tone and P3 wide colour support. When screens get damaged we can replace either just the LCD panel or the complete display assembly.</p>

                    <h2>First Apple Silicon Air</h2>
                    <p>The MacBook Air M1 was a massive change for Apple even though it looked exactly the same as the Intel model from the outside. Same chassis, same display design with the thicker bezels compared to the newer M2 models. No notch on this one, just the standard bezel design that Apple used for years.</p>
                    
                    <p>Inside the display assembly theres the LCD panel, backlight, camera module and display cables. When we do LCD only repairs we swap just the panel and leave everything else in place. When full display replacement is needed the whole assembly gets replaced.</p>

                    <div class="info-box">
                        <p><strong>Model Specifications:</strong><br>
                        Model: MacBook Air 13" M1 (2020)<br>
                        Model Identifier: A2337<br>
                        Display: 13.3" Retina, 2560 x 1600<br>
                        Chip: Apple M1</p>
                    </div>

                    <h2>LCD Only Replacement</h2>
                    <p>LCD only replacement for the MacBook Air M1 means swapping just the internal LCD panel while still keeping your original display housing intact. Metal frame stays, camera module stays, backlight assembly and cabling stays in place. We just remove the damaged panel and fit a new one.</p>
                    
                    <p>This repair is available when the display housing meets the eligibility requirements. No dents, no bends in the frame. No signs of liquid exposure around the display. Bezel and corners need to be in good condition. The team at MacBook Screen Repair check all of this at assessment before quoting.</p>
                    
                    <p>LCD only is our preferred repair when conditions allow for it. Its more targeted than full display replacement. Keeps your original housing and camera. True Tone usually stays working because the original electronics remain in place.</p>

                    <h2>Full Display Replacement</h2>
                    <p>Full display replacement for the MacBook Air M1 is necessary when the housing has damage. Dented frame, bent corners, liquid exposure around the display, cracked bezels. These situations mean LCD only wont work properly and full replacement is the way to go.</p>
                    
                    <p>With full display replacement we swap the entire lid assembly. New housing, new LCD panel, new camera, new backlight, new cables. As such its a bigger repair than LCD only but sometimes thats what the MacBook needs to get working again.</p>
                    
                    <p>Full display replacement can affect True Tone. Apple ties this feature to the original display through firmware pairing. The replacement assembly doesnt have this pairing and independent repairers cant restore it. Everything else works fine but True Tone may not be available after.</p>

                    <h2>Common Screen Issues</h2>
                    <p>The M1 Air has been around for a few years now so weve seen alot of them come through with screen issues. Cracked screens from drops are the most common. Dead displays where nothing shows on screen. Flickering, lines across the display, backlight problems where parts of the screen are brighter or dimmer than they should be.</p>
                    
                    <p>Because these MacBooks have been in use for several years now the housings have often taken some wear and tear which can affect eligibility for LCD only repair. We assess each one individually.</p>

                    <h2>M1 vs Intel Air</h2>
                    <p>The M1 Air looks identical to the 2020 Intel Air from the outside. Both have model numbers starting with A2. The M1 is A2337, the Intel is A2179. If your not sure which one you have check About This Mac or bring it in and we can identify it for you.</p>
                    
                    <p>The repair process is similar for both models but the parts are different so its important to know which one you have before ordering parts.</p>

                    <h2>Drop Off Service</h2>
                    <p>All MacBook Air M1 screen repairs are drop off only.
