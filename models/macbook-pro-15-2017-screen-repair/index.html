                    <h2>MacBook Pro 15" 2017 Display Overview</h2>
                    <p>The 2017 MacBook Pro 15" continued the Touch Bar design that Apple introduced the previous year. Model identifier A1707 applies to both the 2016 and 2017 15" Touch Bar models, with internal processor upgrades distinguishing the 2017 release. The 7th generation Intel Kaby Lake processors provided modest improvements over the initial release. These machines still see regular use today, making screen repair a practical option when display damage occurs.</p>
                    
                    <p>Mac Screen Repair Sydney specialise in the aspects of Retina display repair for 15" 2017 MacBook Pro models. The A1707 uses a 2880 x 1800 panel that delivers sharp visuals for professional work. We've repaired alot of these Touch Bar models since they first released. Our technicians know the internal layout and proper procedures for working on this generation.</p>

                    <h2>Screen Repair Methods</h2>
                    <p>Two repair approaches suit the 15" 2017 depending on your situation. LCD only replacement removes the damaged internal panel while preserving your original aluminium housing, camera assembly, and backlight. This method requires housing free of dents, bends, or structural damage. Full display assembly replacement swaps the entire top section including housing when damage prevents LCD only repair.</p>
                    
                    <p>The team at Mac Screen Repair Sydney examine your MacBook before recommending a repair path. We dont push expensive assembly replacements unnecessarily. When your housing is in good shape, LCD only gives you the same display quality at lower cost. Your specific damage and housing condition determine our recommendation.</p>

                    <h2>Display Specifications</h2>
                    <p>The A1707 2017 model features a 15.4-inch LED-backlit IPS Retina display at 2880 x 1800 resolution. This provides 220 pixels per inch which renders text and images sharply. The panel supports P3 wide colour gamut for accurate colour reproduction in creative applications. Maximum brightness reaches 500 nits, adequate for most indoor environments.</p>
                    
                    <p>Unlike the later 2018 models, the 2017 15" does not include True Tone technology. The display lacks automatic white balance adjustment based on ambient lighting. This simplifies repair considerations since theres no True Tone calibration data to preserve or lose. Replacement panels match the original P3 colour support and brightness specifications.</p>

                    <h2>Common Issues We Repair</h2>
                    <p>Physical impacts cause most screen repairs on 2017 15" models. Cracked glass, LCD fractures, and pressure damage from objects resting on closed laptops. The team have seen the full range of display damage on these machines. Some screens show single impact points with radiating cracks, others display broad LCD failure across the panel.</p>
                    
                    <p>The A1707 generation became known for display cable issues often called flexgate. The cable running from the display to the logic board passes through the hinge area where repeated opening creates wear. Symptoms include a bright band at the bottom of the screen, flickering, or complete display failure at certain angles. We diagnose whether issues stem from cable wear versus panel damage.</p>

                    <h2>Flexgate and Cable Wear</h2>
                    <p>The 2016-2017 Touch Bar MacBook Pro models have a documented history of display cable failures. Apple extended warranty coverage for affected units, though many machines now fall outside that program. The display cable design in these models creates stress during normal operation. Opening and closing the lid repeatedly causes gradual wear that eventually manifests as display problems.</p>
                    
                    <p>Early signs include the backlight failing at the bottom edge, creating a stage light appearance. As wear progresses, the entire display may flicker or fail intermittently. Some users notice problems only at certain lid angles. Full display assembly replacement addresses cable issues definitively since it includes a new cable assembly.</p>

                    <h2>No True Tone Concerns</h2>
                    <p>The 2017 15" MacBook Pro predates True Tone implementation on the 15" models. This technology didnt arrive until the 2018 refresh. For repair purposes, this simplifies decision making. Theres no calibration data to preserve regardless of which repair method we use. Both LCD only and full assembly replacement deliver the same display functionality after repair.</p>
                    
                    <p>The display still provides excellent P3 colour gamut coverage and accurate colour reproduction. Professional users doing colour sensitive work get reliable results from properly calibrated replacement panels. We test colour accuracy before returning repaired devices.</p>

                    <h2>Pricing and Service</h2>
                    <p>MacBook Pro 15" 2017 screen repair pricing depends on the repair type required. LCD only replacement costs less when your housing qualifies. Full assembly replacement addresses both panel and housing damage when needed. We provide quotes after inspecting your device since photos dont show all relevant condition details. Assessment carries no obligation.</p>
                    
                    <p>Most repairs complete within 24-48 hours depending on parts availability. We maintain stock of common panels and can source components quickly. Rush service may be available for time sensitive situations. Contact us to discuss your specific needs.</p>

                    <h2>Extending Your MacBook's Life</h2>
                    <p>The 2017 15" MacBook Pro remains capable hardware for many tasks. Quad-core Intel processors and dedicated AMD graphics handle professional workloads competently. Screen repair extends the functional life of your investment significantly. Rather than replacing functional hardware due to display damage, professional repair restores full capability at reasonable cost.</p>
                    
                    <p>Mac Screen Repair Sydney has performed many A1707 repairs since this model released. We understand the specific considerations for this generation including flexgate issues. Reach out today to discuss your MacBook Pro 15" 2017 screen repair.</p>

                    <h3>My screen has a bright line at bottom. Is this flexgate?</h3>
                    <p>A bright band or stage lighting at the bottom of the screen typically indicates display cable wear, commonly called flexgate. This issue progressively worsens and eventually requires repair.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Does this model have True Tone?</h3>
