                    <h2>MacBook Air 15" M2 Screen Repair</h2>
                    <p>At MacBook Screen Repair we specialise in the aspects of screen replacement for the MacBook Air 15 inch M2 released in 2023. This is model identifier A2941. The team provide LCD only replacement and full display assembly replacement depending on what condition the housing is in.</p>
                    
                    <p>The 15 inch MacBook Air with M2 chip was the first 15 inch Air that Apple made. Before this the Air was only available in 13 inch. The display is a 15.3 inch Liquid Retina panel running at 2880 x 1864 resolution with P3 wide colour and True Tone support. When screens get damaged we can replace either just the LCD panel or the complete display assembly.</p>

                    <h2>First 15 inch Air</h2>
                    <p>The MacBook Air 15" M2 was a big deal when it came out because Apple had never made a 15 inch Air before. Same thin and light design as the 13 inch but with alot more screen space. The notch design at the top houses the camera just like the 13 inch M2 model.</p>
                    
                    <p>Inside the display assembly theres the LCD panel, backlight, camera module and display cables. The larger panel means more surface area which is great for working but also means more area that can potentially get damaged. We repair these the same way as the 13 inch models.</p>

                    <div class="info-box">
                        <p><strong>Model Specifications:</strong><br>
                        Model: MacBook Air 15" M2 (2023)<br>
                        Model Identifier: A2941<br>
                        Display: 15.3" Liquid Retina, 2880 x 1864<br>
                        Chip: Apple M2</p>
                    </div>

                    <h2>LCD Only Replacement</h2>
                    <p>LCD only replacement for the MacBook Air 15" M2 means swapping just the internal LCD panel while still keeping your original display housing intact. Metal frame stays, camera module stays, backlight assembly and all the cabling stays in place. We remove the damaged panel and fit a new one.</p>
                    
                    <p>This repair is available when the display housing meets the eligibility requirements. No dents, no bends, no warping in the frame. No liquid exposure around the display. Bezel and corners in good condition. The team at MacBook Screen Repair check all of this when you drop off.</p>
                    
                    <p>LCD only is what we prefer to do when the housing allows. More targeted repair than full display replacement. Keeps your original housing and camera. True Tone usually stays working because the original electronics remain in place.</p>

                    <h2>Full Display Replacement</h2>
                    <p>Full display replacement for the MacBook Air 15" M2 is necessary when the housing has damage. Dented frame, bent corners, liquid got into the display area, cracked bezels. In these situations LCD only wont work properly and full replacement is needed.</p>
                    
                    <p>With full display replacement we swap the entire lid assembly. New housing, new LCD panel, new camera, new backlight, new cables. As such its a bigger repair than LCD only but sometimes its what the MacBook needs.</p>
                    
                    <p>Full display replacement can affect True Tone functionality. Apple ties this feature to the original display through firmware pairing. The replacement assembly doesnt have this pairing and independent repairers cant restore it. Everything else works fine but True Tone may not be available after.</p>

                    <h2>Common Screen Issues</h2>
                    <p>We see similar screen problems on the 15 inch M2 Air as we do on other MacBook Air models. Cracked screens from drops and impacts are the most common. The larger display means theres more surface area that can potentially crack. Dead displays, flickering, lines across the screen, backlight problems.</p>
                    
                    <p>The 15 inch size makes it a bit more awkward to carry which can lead to drops. Weve seen quite a few come in with cracked corners from being dropped while moving around or knocked off desks.</p>

                    <h2>Identifying Your Model</h2>
                    <p>The MacBook Air 15" M2 is model A2941. Check your model by clicking the Apple menu and selecting About This Mac. It shows the model name and year. The model identifier is also printed on the bottom near the regulatory markings.</p>
                    
                    <p>If your not sure whether you have the M2 or M3 version of the 15 inch Air bring it in and we can check. They look very similar from the outside so the model number is the best way to confirm.</p>

                    <h2>Drop Off Service</h2>
                    <p>All MacBook Air 15" M2 screen repairs are drop off only. You bring the MacBook in, we assess the damage and housing condition, work out whether LCD only or full display replacement is needed and give you accurate pricing before any work starts.</p>
                    
                    <p>We service customers across Western Sydney, The Hills District and North West Sydney. Parramatta, Castle Hill, Blacktown, Penrith, Rouse Hill, Kellyville and surrounding areas.</p>
