                    <h2>What is Full Display Replacement</h2>
                    <p>At MacBook Screen Repair Sydney we offer full display assembly replacement for MacBooks where <a href="/services/lcd-only-macbook-screen-repair/">LCD only repair</a> isnt possible. This involves replacing the entire display unit including the metal housing, LCD panel, backlight assembly, camera module and all internal cabling. The complete lid assembly gets swapped out.</p>
                    
                    <p>Full display replacement is necessary when there is structural damage to the display housing. Dented frames, bent corners, cracked bezels, warped housings, liquid exposure around the display area. These situations mean <a href="/services/lcd-only-macbook-screen-repair/">LCD only</a> wont work because the housing itself is compromised. The team have seen alot of MacBooks come through that need full replacement.</p>
                    
                    <p>This repair type replaces everything in the lid. You get a new housing, new LCD panel, new camera, new backlight assembly, new cables. Its a complete unit that gets installed onto your MacBook. More involved than LCD only but sometimes its the only option.</p>

                    <h2>When Full Display Replacement is Required</h2>
                    <p>Full display replacement becomes necessary in specific situations. The most common is impact damage that affects the frame. Someone drops their MacBook, the screen cracks, but the frame also takes a hit. Dents in the metal, bends at the corners, warping of the lid. This rules out <a href="/services/lcd-only-macbook-screen-repair/">LCD only replacement</a>.</p>
                    
                    <p>Liquid damage is another common reason. If liquid has reached the display area it can affect the backlight layers, the camera, the cabling. Even if the LCD panel itself seems okay the housing is compromised. We cant just swap the panel and leave contaminated components in place.</p>
                    
                    <div class="info-box warning">
                        <p><strong>Situations requiring full display replacement:</strong></p>
                        <ul style="margin-top: 0.5rem; margin-bottom: 0;">
                            <li>Dents, bends or warping in the display frame</li>
                            <li>Liquid exposure on or around the display components</li>
                            <li>Cracked bezels or damaged screen cover</li>
                            <li>Structural damage to the lid housing</li>
                            <li>Impact damage affecting the frame</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                    <h2>What Gets Replaced</h2>
                    <p>Full display replacement means everything in the lid gets swapped. The metal housing that forms the lid. The LCD panel inside. The backlight assembly with its diffuser sheets and LED strip. The FaceTime camera module. The display cables that connect to the logic board. The hinges are usually the only thing that stays.</p>
                    
                    <p>This is a significant repair. Its more costly than <a href="/services/lcd-only-macbook-screen-repair/">LCD only</a> because youre getting all those components not just the panel. But when the housing is damaged there isnt really an alternative. A new panel in a damaged housing creates problems. Full replacement sorts the whole thing properly. Check our <a href="/pricing-guide/">pricing guide</a> for indicative costs.</p>

                    <h2>Apple Feature Behaviour After Replacement</h2>
                    <p>Some Apple features depend on original hardware calibration. <a href="/services/true-tone-missing-after-screen-repair/">True Tone</a> is the main one that can be affected by full display replacement. Apple ties True Tone to the original display assembly through firmware pairing. When you replace the whole assembly that pairing is broken.</p>
                    
                    <p>Independent repairers dont have access to Apples calibration tools. We cant restore <a href="/services/true-tone-missing-after-screen-repair/">True Tone</a> after full display replacement. This is an Apple system limitation not something we can work around. The display will work perfectly fine for everything else but True Tone may show as unavailable.</p>
                    
                    <div class="info-box">
                        <p><strong>Important:</strong> We never promise to restore <a href="/services/true-tone-missing-after-screen-repair/">True Tone</a> after full display replacement. Apple controls this feature through their proprietary systems. Independent repairers cannot access these calibration tools. Other display functions work normally.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h2>The Repair Process</h2>
                    <p>Full display replacement involves removing the damaged display assembly from your MacBook and fitting the replacement unit. The team disconnect the display cables from the logic board, remove the hinge screws and lift off the complete lid assembly. Then the new assembly goes on in reverse.</p>
                    
                    <p>This takes longer than <a href="/services/lcd-only-macbook-screen-repair/">LCD only repair</a>. Theres more to disconnect and reconnect. The display calibration and alignment need to be right. We test everything once its installed. Turnaround depends on parts availability for your model. We give you a timeframe at assessment.</p>

                    <h3>Parts and Quality</h3>
                    <p>We use high quality aftermarket display assemblies. Apple doesnt sell genuine complete assemblies to independent repairers. The units we use are manufactured to match original specifications. Same panel quality, same housing fit, same camera functionality. Just sourced through different supply chains.</p>

                    <h3>Models We Service</h3>
                    <p>Full display replacement is available across the <a href="/models/">MacBook range</a>. Recent Apple Silicon models like the <a href="/models/macbook-pro-14-m4-screen-repair/">MacBook Pro 14" M4</a>, <a href="/models/macbook-pro-16-m3-screen-repair/">MacBook Pro 16" M3</a> and <a href="/models/macbook-air-13-m3-screen-repair/">MacBook Air M3</a>. Older Intel models including the <a href="/models/macbook-pro-15-touch-bar-screen-repair/">15" Touch Bar MacBook Pro</a> and <a href="/models/macbook-pro-13-retina-2012-2015-screen-repair/">13" Retina models</a>. We cover most MacBooks from 2012 onwards.</p>

                    <h2>Compared to LCD Only</h2>
                    <p>Full display replacement costs more than <a href="/services/lcd-only-macbook-screen-repair/">LCD only</a>. Youre getting the whole assembly not just one component. But the situations that require full replacement are situations where LCD only simply wont work. Its not an upsell or unnecessary upgrade. When the housing is damaged full replacement is what the repair needs.</p>
                    
                    <p>Some customers ask if we can try <a href="/services/lcd-only-macbook-screen-repair/">LCD only</a> first. We dont do this because if the housing is damaged a new panel wont solve the problem. We assess properly upfront and tell you which repair type is appropriate for your situation. Honest assessment means no wasted time or money.</p>

                    <h2>Warranty Coverage</h2>
                    <p>Full display replacements come with a 60 day limited warranty. This covers the replacement assembly and our workmanship. If theres a defect in the display unit or something goes wrong with the installation bring it back. Read our full <a href="/warranty/">warranty policy</a> for details.</p>
                    
                    <p>The warranty doesnt cover new physical damage, liquid damage, impact damage or issues unrelated to the display replacement. Its warranty on the component and work not general insurance on the MacBook. Same exclusions as our <a href="/services/lcd-only-macbook-screen-repair/">LCD only</a> warranty.</p>

                    <h2>Drop Off Assessment</h2>
                    <p>All repairs start with drop off assessment. Bring your MacBook in and the team check what type of repair is needed. We look at the frame condition, check for liquid exposure, assess whether <a href="/services/lcd-only-macbook-screen-repair/">LCD only</a> is possible or if full replacement is required. Then we explain options and <a href="/pricing-guide/">pricing</a>.</p>
                    
                    <p>We service customers across Western Sydney, The Hills District and North West Sydney areas. <a href="/areas/parramatta/">Parramatta</a>, <a href="/areas/castle-hill/">Castle Hill</a>, <a href="/areas/blacktown/">Blacktown</a>, <a href="/areas/penrith/">Penrith</a>, <a href="/areas/rouse-hill/">Rouse Hill</a>, <a href="/areas/kellyville/">Kellyville</a> and <a href="/areas/">surrounding suburbs</a>. Drop off only service with proper in person assessment.</p>
