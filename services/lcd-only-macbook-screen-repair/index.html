                    <h2>What is LCD Only Replacement</h2>
                    <p>At MacBook Screen Repair Sydney we specialise in the aspects of LCD panel only replacement for <a href="/models/">MacBook Air and MacBook Pro models</a>. This repair type replaces just the internal LCD panel while keeping your original display housing intact. The metal frame, camera module, backlight layers and all the cabling in the lid stay in place. We just swap out the broken panel for a new one.</p>
                    
                    <p>LCD only replacement is our preferred repair when the conditions are right. Its more targeted than <a href="/services/full-display-macbook-screen-replacement/">full display replacement</a>. The team remove the damaged panel from your existing housing and fit a replacement. Your original housing stays complete with its camera, backlight assembly and display cables all undisturbed.</p>
                    
                    <p>This approach works well for MacBooks with cracked screens, dead panels, flickering displays or lines running through the image where the housing itself is still in good condition. The panel is whats failed not the whole assembly. So we just replace that component.</p>

                    <h2>Eligibility Requirements</h2>
                    <p>LCD only replacement has strict eligibility requirements. Not every MacBook qualifies for this repair type. The team check these conditions when you drop off and we wont proceed if the requirements arent met. Theres no workaround or exception.</p>
                    
                    <div class="info-box">
                        <p><strong>All conditions must be satisfied:</strong></p>
                        <ul style="margin-top: 0.5rem; margin-bottom: 0;">
                            <li>No dents, bends or warping in the display frame or metal housing</li>
                            <li>No signs of liquid exposure on or around the display or backlight layers</li>
                            <li>Screen cover, bezel and corners in good physical condition</li>
                            <li>Display housing structurally sound with no cracks</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    
                    <p>If any of these conditions fail LCD only replacement cannot be performed. A new panel fitted into a damaged housing wont seat properly. It creates problems with the backlight, can cause uneven pressure on the panel and leads to issues down the track. We refuse unsuitable repairs rather than do work that wont last. In those cases <a href="/services/full-display-macbook-screen-replacement/">full display replacement</a> is the alternative.</p>

                    <h2>What We Check at Assessment</h2>
                    <p>When you bring your MacBook in the team do a proper assessment. We look at the display frame for any dents, bends or warping. We check the bezel and corners for cracks or damage. We look for liquid damage indicators around the display area. The whole housing gets inspected.</p>
                    
                    <p>This assessment takes a few minutes. We can usually tell you on the spot whether LCD only is possible or if <a href="/services/full-display-macbook-screen-replacement/">full display replacement</a> is needed. Some damage isnt obvious from photos which is why we require drop off assessment. Things like slight frame warping or hidden liquid exposure only show up when we physically check the machine.</p>

                    <h2>What Gets Preserved</h2>
                    <p>LCD only replacement keeps alot of your original hardware in place. The display housing with its metal frame stays yours. The FaceTime camera module remains original. The backlight assembly including the diffuser sheets and LED strip stay in place. All the cabling that connects the display to the logic board remains undisturbed.</p>
                    
                    <p>This matters for a few reasons. Your original camera stays so no change there. The backlight layers that affect screen brightness and uniformity are the ones that came with your Mac. And because were not replacing the whole assembly features like <a href="/services/true-tone-missing-after-screen-repair/">True Tone</a> that depend on the original housing often continue working.</p>

                    <h2>When LCD Only Isnt Possible</h2>
                    <p>Some MacBooks come in where LCD only simply wont work. The team see this regularly. Someone drops their Mac, the screen cracks, but the impact also dented the frame. Or liquid got into the machine and affected the display area. Or the corners of the housing are cracked from the damage.</p>
                    
                    <p>In these situations we cant do LCD only. The housing itself needs replacing not just the panel inside. We tell you this at assessment. <a href="/services/full-display-macbook-screen-replacement/">Full display replacement</a> is the alternative when the housing is compromised. We dont try to talk you into it or upsell. Its just the reality of what the repair requires.</p>

                    <h2>The Repair Process</h2>
                    <p>For LCD only repair we carefully separate the damaged panel from your display housing. The LCD is bonded to the housing so this requires proper technique and tooling. We clean everything up, prepare the housing and install the replacement panel. Then reconnect and test.</p>
                    
                    <p>Most LCD only repairs are same day if we have parts in stock for your model. Some less common models might take a day or two while we source the panel. We give you a timeframe at assessment once we know what youve got and confirm parts availability. See our <a href="/pricing-guide/">pricing guide</a> for indicative costs.</p>

                    <h3>Models Covered</h3>
                    <p>LCD only replacement is available for most <a href="/models/">MacBook Air and MacBook Pro models</a>. Apple Silicon machines including <a href="/models/macbook-air-13-m1-screen-repair/">M1</a>, <a href="/models/macbook-air-13-m2-screen-repair/">M2</a>, <a href="/models/macbook-air-13-m3-screen-repair/">M3</a> and <a href="/models/macbook-air-13-m4-screen-repair/">M4</a> models. Intel MacBooks going back several years. The chip inside doesnt affect whether we can do LCD only. What matters is the physical condition of your display housing.</p>
                    
                    <p>The team have done LCD only repairs on <a href="/models/macbook-air-13-m3-screen-repair/">MacBook Air 13 inch</a>, <a href="/models/macbook-air-15-m3-screen-repair/">MacBook Air 15 inch</a>, <a href="/models/macbook-pro-13-m2-screen-repair/">MacBook Pro 13 inch</a>, <a href="/models/macbook-pro-14-m3-screen-repair/">MacBook Pro 14 inch</a>, <a href="/models/macbook-pro-15-touch-bar-screen-repair/">MacBook Pro 15 inch</a> and <a href="/models/macbook-pro-16-m3-screen-repair/">MacBook Pro 16 inch</a> models. Touch Bar and non Touch Bar variants. <a href="/models/">View all models we service</a>.</p>

                    <h2>Warranty</h2>
                    <p>We provide a 60 day limited warranty on LCD panel replacements. This covers the replaced panel and our workmanship. If something goes wrong with the panel we installed or the work we did bring it back and we sort it out. Full details on our <a href="/warranty/">warranty policy</a> page.</p>
                    
                    <p>The warranty does not cover physical damage that happens after the repair. It doesnt cover liquid damage, impact damage or issues unrelated to the screen replacement. Its a warranty on the component and work we did not an insurance policy on your MacBook going forward.</p>

                    <h2>Drop Off Only</h2>
                    <p>All repairs are drop off only. You bring your MacBook to us, we assess it and discuss options. No shipping, no mail in service. This lets us properly inspect the machine, have an actual conversation about what can be done and give you accurate <a href="/pricing-guide/">pricing</a> based on what we find.</p>
                    
                    <p>We service customers across Western Sydney, The Hills District and North West Sydney. People come from <a href="/areas/parramatta/">Parramatta</a>, <a href="/areas/castle-hill/">Castle Hill</a>, <a href="/areas/blacktown/">Blacktown</a>, <a href="/areas/penrith/">Penrith</a>, <a href="/areas/rouse-hill/">Rouse Hill</a>, <a href="/areas/kellyville/">Kellyville</a> and <a href="/areas/">all the surrounding suburbs</a>. The drop off approach works well for proper assessment.</p>

                            Yes LCD only is typically more affordable because were replacing just one component rather than the entire display assembly. The exact pricing depends on your MacBook model. Check the pricing guide or bring it in for assessment.
