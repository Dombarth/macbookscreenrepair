                    <h2>What is True Tone</h2>
                    <p>True Tone is an Apple display feature that adjusts the colour temperature of your screen based on ambient lighting. It uses sensors to measure the light in your environment and shifts the display warmer or cooler to match. The idea is that the screen looks more natural like paper rather than having a fixed colour temperature regardless of your surroundings.</p>
                    
                    <p>True Tone was introduced on the 9.7 inch iPad Pro and later came to MacBook Pro and MacBook Air models. Its controlled through System Preferences or System Settings and can be toggled on or off. When working you dont really notice it. The display just looks right for the lighting conditions.</p>

                    <h2>How Apple Controls True Tone</h2>
                    <p>Apple ties True Tone to the original display assembly through firmware pairing. During manufacturing the display is calibrated to work with the specific MacBook its installed in. Data about this calibration is stored in both the display assembly and the MacBook. This pairing is what makes True Tone function.</p>
                    
                    <p>When the display assembly is replaced that calibration relationship breaks. The new display doesnt have the same pairing with your MacBook. Apple manages this through their proprietary systems and independent repairers dont have access to the tools needed to create new pairings or restore the calibration.</p>
                    
                    <div class="info-box">
                        <p><strong>Important:</strong> Independent repairers cannot restore True Tone after display replacement. This is controlled by Apple through their firmware and calibration systems. We have no way to access or modify these settings.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h2>LCD Only vs Full Display Replacement</h2>
                    <p>The repair type affects True Tone differently. Understanding this helps set realistic expectations.</p>
                    
                    <h3>LCD Only Replacement</h3>
                    <p>LCD only replacement keeps your original display housing intact. The metal frame, camera module, backlight layers and display electronics all stay in place. We just replace the internal LCD panel itself. Because the housing and its electronics remain original True Tone usually continues working after LCD only repair.</p>
                    
                    <p>The calibration data and pairing information is stored in components that stay with the housing. When we swap just the panel and leave everything else the system often recognises the display as original. True Tone keeps working in most cases. Not guaranteed but thats the typical outcome.</p>

                    <h3>Full Display Replacement</h3>
                    <p>Full display replacement swaps the entire lid assembly. New housing, new panel, new camera, new backlight, new cables. Everything. The replacement assembly doesnt have the calibration pairing with your MacBook. True Tone is likely to show as unavailable after full display replacement.</p>
                    
                    <p>This is not something we can fix or work around. Apple controls the pairing through their systems. The display works perfectly for everything else. Colours are accurate. Brightness is normal. All the other display functions work fine. Its just the automatic ambient light adjustment that may not be available.</p>

                    <h2>What We Can and Cannot Promise</h2>
                    <p>We never promise to restore True Tone after screen repair. For LCD only replacement it usually keeps working. For full display replacement it usually doesnt. But we dont make guarantees either way because Apple controls this feature and we cant predict or influence how their systems behave.</p>
                    
                    <div class="info-box warning">
                        <p><strong>Prohibited claims:</strong> We do not claim to bypass, reprogramme, code or otherwise restore True Tone functionality. We do not imply any Apple endorsement. We do not have access to Apple proprietary tools or calibration systems.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <p>If True Tone is absolutely critical to you and you need it guaranteed to work after repair then Apple authorised service is the only option. They have the tools to pair displays. Independent repairers dont. We tell you this upfront so you can make an informed decision.</p>

                    <h2>Other Apple Features</h2>
                    <p>True Tone is the main feature affected by screen replacement. Other display functions continue to work normally. Brightness adjustment, Night Shift, auto brightness based on ambient light sensor. These are different systems and arent tied to the display pairing the same way.</p>
                    
                    <p>The FaceTime camera works. Touch ID works. The display shows colours accurately. Retina resolution is maintained. Screen brightness goes from full dim to full bright. The display is fully functional. Its specifically the True Tone automatic colour temperature adjustment that can be affected.</p>

                    <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
                    <p>Some customers dont even know True Tone exists or have it turned off anyway. For them it makes no practical difference. Other customers use True Tone all the time and would notice its absence. We explain this at assessment so you know what to expect before the repair happens.</p>
                    
                    <p>The team are upfront about this because its important to set realistic expectations. Screen replacement fixes your cracked, dead or flickering display. It gets your MacBook working again. But some Apple features depend on original hardware and those limitations exist regardless of who does the repair.</p>

                    <h2>Frequently Asked About True Tone</h2>
                    <p>Customers ask about True Tone alot. Here are the straight answers.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Can you restore True Tone?</strong> No. Apple controls this through their systems. Independent repairers dont have access.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Will LCD only keep True Tone working?</strong> Usually yes because the original housing stays in place. Not guaranteed but thats the typical outcome.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Will full display replacement lose True Tone?</strong> Most likely yes. The new assembly isnt paired with your MacBook.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Does the display still work properly without True Tone?</strong> Yes. Colours are accurate, brightness works, everything else functions normally. You just dont get the automatic colour temperature adjustment based on ambient light.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Can I get True Tone restored later?</strong> Only through Apple or an Apple Authorised Service Provider who has the pairing tools.</p>
