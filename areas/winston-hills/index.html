                    <h2>MacBook Screen Repair for Winston Hills</h2>
                    <p>Winston Hills sits between Parramatta and The Hills District. Its a quiet residential area with alot of established families who have been there for decades. The suburb has that comfortable feel where people look after their things and keep them running as long as possible.</p>
                    
                    <p>MacBook repairs from Winston Hills tend to be older machines that people have looked after but the screen has finally given up. These arent careless damage situations. Just wear and tear over years of solid use. The display panel eventually fails even when the rest of the machine is still going strong.</p>
                    
                    <p>We specialise in MacBook screens only. No phones, no general computer repairs, no accessories. Just displays. When a MacBook comes in from Winston Hills with screen problems we know exactly what were looking at and what options are available.</p>

                    <h2>LCD Only Replacement</h2>
                    <p>LCD only replacement is what we prefer when the housing is in good condition. The display housing on older MacBooks is often still pristine even when the panel inside has failed. In these cases we just swap the LCD panel and keep everything else.</p>
                    
                    <p>The eligibility requirements are strict though. No frame damage. No dents or bends. No liquid exposure. The bezel needs to be intact. We check all of this when you drop off and determine whether LCD only is possible for your particular machine.</p>
                    
                    <div class="info-box">
                        <p><strong>LCD Only Eligibility:</strong> Display housing must be undamaged with no dents, bends, liquid exposure or frame warping. Assessment determines eligibility.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h2>Full Display Replacement</h2>
                    <p>Full display replacement becomes necessary when the housing itself is damaged. Frame dents, bent corners, liquid exposure, structural issues. In these situations we replace the entire display assembly. New housing, new panel, new camera, everything.</p>
                    
                    <p>This costs more than LCD only but when the housing is compromised theres no other option. A new panel in a damaged housing causes problems. We explain the situation clearly and give you honest pricing so you can make an informed decision.</p>

                    <h2>Older MacBook Models</h2>
                    <p>Winston Hills has alot of older MacBook models still in daily use. The 2015 to 2019 MacBook Pro models are common. MacBook Air from that era too. These machines were built well and with proper care they last for years.</p>
                    
                    <p>Screen failures on these older models are usually age related. The backlight goes dim, lines appear, or the panel just stops displaying. We can usually fix these with LCD only replacement assuming the housing is in good shape. Its a cost effective way to get more life out of a machine that still works well.</p>

                    <h2>Western Sydney Service</h2>
                    <p>We service MacBook owners across Western Sydney. Winston Hills, Northmead, North Rocks, Baulkham Hills, Constitution Hill, Parramatta. The whole area. Drop off in person is required so we can assess the machine properly.</p>
                    
                    <p>You bring the MacBook in. We check the screen damage and examine the display housing condition. Takes a few minutes. Then we explain what repair is needed and give accurate pricing. No obligation until you decide to proceed.</p>
