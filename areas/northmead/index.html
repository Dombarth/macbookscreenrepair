                    <h2>MacBook Screen Repair for Northmead</h2>
                    <p>Northmead is close to Parramatta and has easy access to public transport. Good bus connections and not far from the train lines. We see MacBooks from students and young professionals in this area. People commuting into the city for work or study who rely on their machines daily.</p>
                    
                    <p>The MacBook Air models are popular here probably due to the lighter weight for commuting. Carrying a laptop on buses and trains every day means you want something light. But those daily commutes also mean more opportunities for damage. Crowded trains, bumps and knocks, things falling on bags.</p>
                    
                    <p>We specialise in MacBook screens only. No phones, no iPads, no general repairs. Just MacBook displays. LCD only replacement when possible and full display replacement when necessary.</p>

                    <h2>LCD Only Replacement</h2>
                    <p>LCD only replacement is what we do when the display housing is undamaged. We take out the old LCD panel and put in a new one. Everything else stays. The metal frame, the camera at the top, the backlight assembly, all of it remains in place.</p>
                    
                    <p>The requirements for LCD only are strict. The housing cant have any dents or bends. No signs of liquid exposure. Bezel in good condition. We assess all of this when you drop off and let you know whether LCD only is an option for your particular machine.</p>
                    
                    <div class="info-box">
                        <p><strong>LCD Only Eligibility:</strong> Display housing must be undamaged with no dents, bends, liquid exposure or frame warping. Assessment determines eligibility.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h2>Full Display Replacement</h2>
                    <p>Full display replacement is the option when the housing itself is damaged. Bent frame, dented corners, liquid in the display area, cracked bezel. When these issues are present we replace the whole assembly. New housing, new panel, new camera module, everything.</p>
                    
                    <p>It costs more than LCD only but when housing damage is involved theres no other reliable option. We explain everything at assessment so you understand why a particular repair approach is needed.</p>

                    <h2>Commuter MacBook Issues</h2>
                    <p>MacBooks that travel daily have their own set of common problems. Screen damage from being squeezed in crowded transport. Cracks from bags being dropped or bumped. Sometimes things fall on the bag while its on the floor of a train.</p>
                    
                    <p>Pressure cracks are common too. The screen gets pushed somehow and develops internal damage even without visible external cracks. The display shows lines or dark areas but the glass looks fine. These can usually be fixed with LCD only if the housing is undamaged.</p>

                    <h2>Western Sydney Service</h2>
                    <p>We service MacBook owners across Western Sydney. Northmead, Winston Hills, North Rocks, Parramatta, Baulkham Hills. The whole region. Drop off your MacBook and we assess it properly before quoting.</p>
                    
                    <p>Bring the machine in. We check the damage and examine the display housing. Takes a few minutes. Then we explain what repair is needed and give you accurate pricing. No pressure and no obligation.</p>

                        <p><strong>MacBook screen damaged in Northmead?</strong> Drop off for assessment. We check the damage and give you honest pricing before any work starts.</p>
